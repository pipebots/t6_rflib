# rflib - RF and Microwave engineering related utility functions

## Overview

This module contains various utility functions that I use in my work on the electromagnetic modelling of sewer pipes. A lot of them are general purpose and can be applied to other situations. The functions themselves are not particularly optimised for performance at the moment.

## Requirements

Requires some standard Python packages for scientific computing. As my current development environment is a bit polluted, I'll list the required packages here. Apologies.

- `Python>=3.6`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

## Tests

To be added. Bad practice, I know.

## Installation

Use `pip install -e .` in the folder to which you clone or download this. This will install `rflib` as an "editable" package in your current environment, meaning you should just do a `git pull` in the future to get any updates.

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome and are in fact actively sought! Please contact Viktor either at [eenvdo@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:eenvdo@leeds.ac.uk) or on the `Pipebots` Slack.
